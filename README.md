# CS350_Emmbeded_Systems

The Final Project was to make a thermostat using an embedded system. The end product had to be able to check different tasks at varied time periods to save power. A user also should be able to increase or decrease the thermostat temperature which would determine if the heater or in this case, LED light was turned on or off. 

For this project I did a good job at make simple functions that can be called on to do their tasks. This kept the main program easy to maintain and read. 

Looking back at this program, I should have added more commments to the program to make it even easier to read and know quickly what each function does without having to looking into the code. 

The tools and resources I have added to my support network is a new language to program in, C. A low level language like C has taught me how to manage memory and resouces of an embedded system. 

The major skill that I have learned is how to program embedded systems and write code to operate IoT devices. This could be immensely helpful in the real world because of all the IoT devices that control things from our cars to devices in our homes. 

The way I made the Final Project maintainable, readable, and adaptable is by writing out comments and make functions that were called to do small tasks. This way functions could be updated or changed without having to find every instance of that code to make a change. I also tried to keep my function names appropriate so someone should be able to just read the name and know what the function does within the program.
